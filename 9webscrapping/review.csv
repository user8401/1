3,Dinesh maran,"I purchased it for Rs 2K. Given the price, I do not recommend or advise otherwise. I have listed below my experience with this watch. This will help buyers making informed buying choice.Pros:1. Big enough and looks good.2. Companion App with  your rank in your city and globally.3. Ability to send data to standard goole health app.4. Enough sports mode with parameters like aerobic training effect and required cooling time, step length etc. It gives you more insight about exercise.5. Custom watch face. Though it gives basic information only. Choosing display values would have been better.6. Mostly accurate steps, heart beat rate and SpO2. However, I find it gives lesser steps and distance covered if you walk fast. The gap is about 10%.7. Senses activity and prompts you to start tracking.8.Alexa for weather update etc.9. Music and camera control from watch.10. Enough bright under  sun at 100% nits.11. I assume data, micro code and app code control lies with fastrack(Tata). Better than giving data in control of Chinese companies.12. Silicon strap is good.13. Control of apps that can send messages to watch and display is good enough.14. The microphone and speaker are very good. You can really make good calls with this watch.15. Battery runs for 2-3 days with all tracking on and 60% brightness.Cons:1. The biggest issue is that automatic functions like spo2, sleep, stress etc. stop abruptly. Several times it did not record sleep, her, stress at all. I feel if you restart the watch everyday, it still works better.2. Sleep tracker gives basic values and looks like it  works for a specific period only. If you wake once even for nature's call, it stops tracking sleep. Overall, it's useless.3. Alexa disconnects automatically and needs to be setup again. Not sure if this is alexa app or something else but the user experience for this function is not that pleasant due to this issue4. The knob doesn't have scroll function. It rotates for nothing.5. Requires tight fitting to track values making it inconvenient to wear it for longer periods.6. Tucking the strap inside is inconvenient. Some other brands also have the same but it is not good for men with hairs on hand and watch requiring tight fit to track values. A conventional loop would be better.7. If you accidently replace a watch face with your custom face, it is impossible to bring it back. I am unable not find a way so far.8. No amoled screen. I personally do not think it is required for watch.In summary, if you do not rely on automatic functions and can provide manual inputs, not keen on tracking sleep and live with cons, it is worth a buy at this price tag else not."
