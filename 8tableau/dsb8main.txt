a. 1D (Linear) Data Visualization:

Histogram: Visualize the distribution of a numerical variable such as age or petal length.
Bar chart: Represent the frequency or count of categorical variables such as education level or species.
b. 2D (Planar) Data Visualization:

Scatter plot: Plot the relationship between two numerical variables, such as age and income or sepal length and sepal width.
Line chart: Show the trend or change in a numerical variable over time or another continuous variable.
c. 3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization:

3D scatter plot: Visualize the relationship among three numerical variables, such as age, income, and education level.
Bubble chart: Use the size of bubbles to represent the values of three variables.
d. Temporal Data Visualization:

Line chart or area chart: Illustrate the change in a numerical variable over time.
Calendar view: Show the values of a variable on a calendar, highlighting specific dates or time periods.
e. Multidimensional Data Visualization:

Parallel coordinates plot: Display multiple numerical variables on parallel axes to identify patterns and relationships.
Radar chart: Compare multiple variables using radial axes to show their values.
f. Tree/Hierarchical Data Visualization:

Tree map: Represent hierarchical data using nested rectangles, where the size of each rectangle corresponds to a variable's value.
Sunburst chart: Visualize hierarchical data as concentric circles, with each level represented by arcs or segments.
g. Network Data Visualization:

Network graph: Display relationships between entities as nodes and links, where nodes represent entities and links represent connections or interactions.
