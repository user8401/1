To integrate Python and Hadoop and perform data analysis using MapReduce in PyHadoop on the forest fire dataset, and also perform data mining in Hive, you can follow these steps:

Prepare the input data: Make sure your forest fire dataset is stored in HDFS or a location accessible to Hadoop.

Data analysis using MapReduce in PyHadoop:

a. Write the mapper and reducer scripts in Python: Create two separate Python scripts, one for the mapper and one for the reducer. The mapper script will read input data line by line and emit key-value pairs, and the reducer script will receive the grouped key-value pairs and perform computations.

The following is an example of a mapper script (mapper.py):

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

# Input comes from standard input (stdin)
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Split the line into fields
    fields = line.strip().split(',')

    # Extract the required fields for analysis
    month = fields[2]
    temp = float(fields[8])
    area = float(fields[12])

    # Emit key-value pairs
    print(f'{month}\t{temp}\t{area}')

The following is an example of a reducer script (reducer.py):

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

current_month = None
total_temp = 0
total_area = 0

# Input comes from standard input (stdin)
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Split the line into fields
    month, temp, area = line.strip().split('\t')

    # Convert temperature and area to float
    temp = float(temp)
    area = float(area)

    # If the current month is equal to the new month, accumulate temperature and area
    if current_month == month:
        total_temp += temp
        total_area += area
    else:
        # If the month has changed, emit the previous month and average temperature and area
        if current_month:
            avg_temp = total_temp / total_area if total_area > 0 else 0
            print(f'{current_month}\t{avg_temp}\t{total_area}')

        # Reset the current month, temperature, and area
        current_month = month
        total_temp = temp
        total_area = area

# Emit the last month and average temperature and area
if current_month:
    avg_temp = total_temp / total_area if total_area > 0 else 0
    print(f'{current_month}\t{avg_temp}\t{total_area}')

b. Run the MapReduce job: Use the Hadoop Streaming API to execute the MapReduce job. Here's an example command:

$ hadoop jar <path_to_hadoop_streaming_jar> -input <input_path> -output <output_path> -mapper "python mapper.py" -reducer "python reducer.py"

Replace <path_to_hadoop_streaming_jar> with the actual path to the Hadoop Streaming JAR file, <input_path> with the input data path, and <output_path> with the desired output directory path.

This will run the MapReduce job, and the output will be stored in the specified output directory.

Data mining in Hive:

a. Start the Hive shell:
$ hive
Create a table to store the forest fire dataset:

CREATE TABLE forest_fire (
    X INT,
    Y INT,
    Month STRING,
    Day STRING,
    FFMC FLOAT,
    DMC FLOAT,
    DC FLOAT,
    ISI FLOAT,
    Temp FLOAT,
    RH INT,
    Wind FLOAT,
    Rain FLOAT,
    Area FLOAT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

Load the data into the table:
LOAD DATA INPATH '<input_path>' INTO TABLE forest_fire;

Replace <input_path> with the path to the forest fire dataset.

Perform data mining operations using Hive queries. Here are a few examples:

a. Calculate the average temperature and area for each month:
SELECT Month, AVG(Temp) AS AvgTemperature, SUM(Area) AS TotalArea
FROM forest_fire
GROUP BY Month;

Find the maximum temperature and associated area:
SELECT Temp, Area
FROM forest_fire
WHERE Temp = (SELECT MAX(Temp) FROM forest_fire);

c. Count the number of occurrences for each day:
SELECT Day, COUNT(*) AS Occurrences
FROM forest_fire
GROUP BY Day;
